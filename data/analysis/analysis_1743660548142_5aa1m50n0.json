  "transcript": "Hey, I'm part of, uh, this is Aura Bloom VIP Crystal Club. I get a free crystal every month. This is what came for me. It's not really my style, but I thought my everyday bag is looking a little naked and maybe I could use it as like a bag charm situation. So I was like, what if I just like take it and kind of wrap it around like that? Put it right there. What do we think? Okay. So she's wrapped. This is a little abalone shell. You can see it up close. It's not a necklace that I would wear and I feel like the black cord just kind of blends in with the bag. So now, how cutie pie is she? I love it. I want to put more bag charms on her and I feel like this is like such my vibe. Like I love crystals and things. I'm glad I get to use this in a more unconventional way. Also, I always get a ton of questions about my bag, where my bag is from, all the things. This is a Dragon Diffusion bag. They're all made to order, handmade in India in, um, sustainably made factories, well-paid, fair wage payment, everything like that. And they're extremely, extremely well made. Um, like I opened the package, I could like smell the leather. I can still smell it. Um, and just a little fun fact. If you look inside the bag, there's a St. Christopher's charm, which it I believe is like a traveler's protector protection charm. So super cool and you should check them out."
