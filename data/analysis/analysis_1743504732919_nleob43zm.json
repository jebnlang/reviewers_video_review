  "transcript": "Hey, I'm part of this is Aura Bloom VIP Crystal Club. I get a free crystal every month. This is what came for me. It's not really my style, but I thought my everyday bag is looking a little naked and maybe I could use it as like a bag charm situation. So I was like, what if I just like take it and kind of wrap it around like that? Put it right there. What do we think? Okay. So she's wrapped. This is a little abalone shell. You can see it up close. It's not a necklace that I would wear, and I feel like the black cord just kind of blends in with the bag. So now how cutie pie is she? I love I want to put more bag charms on her. And I feel like this is like such my vibe. I love crystals and things. I'm glad I get to use this in a more unconventional way. Also, I always get a ton of questions about my bag, where my bag is from. All things. This is a Dragon Diffusion bag. They're all made to order handmade in India in um sustainably made factories, well paid, fair wage payment, everything like that. And they're extremely, extremely well made. Um like I opened the package. I could like smell the leather. I can still smell it. Um and just a little fun fact. Look inside the bag. There's a Saint Christopher's charm, which it I believe is like a traveler's protector protection charm. So super cool and you should check them out."
