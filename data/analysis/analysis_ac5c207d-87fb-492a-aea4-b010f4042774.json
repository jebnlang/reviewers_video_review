The absence of narration may make it difficult for viewers to fully understand the content. Consider adding explanatory voice-over. The video could benefit from featuring a wider variety of content elements to increase visual interest."

    "Enhance audio clarity by using an external microphone rather than the built-in camera mic.",
    "Record in a quiet environment to minimize background noise.",
    "Add audio, even if it's just background music or sounds of the dog playing, to enhance the viewing experience.",
    "Include shots of the puppy interacting with people or other objects to create a narrative and increase engagement."
