    "Record in a quiet environment to minimize background noise.",
    "Encourage reviewers to include a verbal component in their reviews, even if it's just a brief description of their pet's reaction.",
    "Provide guidelines to reviewers on how to best showcase the product and its use, such as demonstrating the pet eating the treat."
