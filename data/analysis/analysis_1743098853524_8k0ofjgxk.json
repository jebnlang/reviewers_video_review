      "score": 60,
      "feedback": "The visual quality is inconsistent. Some shots are well-lit and clear, while others are poorly lit and slightly blurry. The framing is generally acceptable, but the camera work could be steadier. More attention to consistent lighting would greatly improve the visual appeal."

      "score": 40,
      "feedback": "The audio quality is a significant weakness. There's noticeable background noise, and the voice clarity is poor. It sounds like the microphone is either too far away or of low quality. This makes it difficult to clearly understand the reviewer's comments and detracts from the overall experience."

      "score": 60,
      "feedback": "The content is moderately engaging. The unboxing process is inherently interesting, but the poor audio and inconsistent visuals make it harder to stay focused. A more dynamic presentation and clearer commentary would improve engagement."

      "score": 70,
      "feedback": "The video effectively captures the unboxing and first impressions. The reviewer expresses their initial thoughts and feelings about the product as they unbox it. However, the impact of these impressions is lessened by the audio and visual issues."
