The absence of narration may make it difficult for viewers to fully understand the content. Consider adding explanatory voice-over. The video could benefit from featuring a wider variety of content elements to increase visual interest."

    "Enhance audio clarity by using an external microphone rather than the built-in camera mic.",
    "Record in a quiet environment to minimize background noise.",
    "Add audio, even simple background music or narration, to enhance engagement.",
    "Vary the shots to include more of the puppy's body and environment, rather than solely focusing on the snout."
