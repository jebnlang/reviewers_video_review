      "feedback": "The content engagement level appears to be moderate. The video contains 1 scene changes, which may make the content feel static. Consider adding more dynamic elements. The absence of narration may make it difficult for viewers to fully understand the content. Consider adding explanatory voice-over. The video could benefit from featuring a wider variety of content elements to increase visual interest."

  "recommendations": [
    "Enhance audio clarity by using an external microphone rather than the built-in camera mic.",
    "Record in a quiet environment to minimize background noise.",
    "Add audio, even if it's just background music or sounds of the puppy playing, to enhance engagement.",
    "Consider adding text overlays with fun facts about Labrador Retrievers or tips for puppy care.",
    "Vary the shots to include more of the puppy's body and its interactions with its environment or people."
